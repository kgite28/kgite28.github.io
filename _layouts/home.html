<div class="proj">  

<b>Georgia Tech</b> Industrial and Systems Engineering Senior Design, 2020 <br><br> 
<img class="projicon" src="/assets/Recycling.svg"/>

<i>The challenge:</i> Georgia World Congress Center (link) faces several economic and social barriers to diverting recyclable waste produced at shows and conferences away from the landfill. <br>

<i>The project:</i> Using analytical methods, we 1) created new waste diversion processes and 2) developed pricing and other incentives to align all parties' goals towards sustainability. <br><br><br>
</div>

<div class="panel"> 
<ul>
<li>Created new processes for sorting and diverting wood, cardboard, carpet, plastic sheeting, and furniture</li>
<li>Calculated appropriate non-compliance fees based on life-cycle assessments (link) to get everyone on the same page, from conference hosts to external cleaning contractors</li>
<li>Collected, analyzed and built simulations with process time data to evaluate these process changes</li>
<li>With past waste haul per conference data, assisted in creation of regression model to predict conference waste hauls, development of new haul pricing structure to incentivize recycling</li>
<li>Contributed to and tested a web application that will help GWCC track and store conference data in a centralized location</li>
<li>Project potential: triple GWCC waste diversion and reduce over 3000 tons of CO2 equivalents (link) in a year</li>
<li>Tied for first place among all ISyE senior design projects in the spring 2020 semester, as judged by ISyE faculty</li>

<b>NCR</b> Small and Medium Business 2019 <br><br>
<img class="projicon" src="/assets/automation.svg"/>
<i>The challenge:</i> As NCR Silver/Small and Medium Business has grown, the process of keeping track of monthly merchant payments has become cumbersome and time-consuming.<br>
<i>The project:</i> I automated parts of the AR process and dug into account data to identify factors influencing merchants' past due balances.<br>

</div>
<div class="panel"> 
<ul>
<li>Understood and mapped process, finding repetitive steps and time sinks</li>
<li>Developed some partial automation of spreadsheet processes with macros, accessing API of  billing management system</li>
<li>Did a deep dive into which merchants found it difficult to keep up with monthly payments and what traits they shared with Tableau/salesforce integration</li>
<li>Identified early communication of billing terms as an opportunity</li>
<li>Potential: save x hours/year as well as save on past due balances</li>
</ul>

<div class="proj">
<b>United Airlines</b> Continuous Improvement and Enterprise Optimization, 2018<br><br>
<img class="projicon" src="/assets/luggage.svg"/>
<i>The challenge:</i> As United flight volume grows at ORD, the complex, large-scale baggage handling process faces more complications and timely delivery of bags to planes and baggage claims becomes more difficult.<br>
<i>The project:</i> I contributed to various aspects of the multi-pronged baggage process improvement initiative, from new communication and signage to better data reporting to better allocation of flights to baggage claims.<br>
more
</div>
<div class="panel">
<ul>
<li>Mapped out bag process and observed, interviewed bag handlers for complete process understanding</li>
<li>Designed dashboard so baggage supervisors could be aware of the most pressing concerns and metrics</li>
<li>Looked at months of baggage claim results, kept bag supervisors updated with informative visualizations and root cause analysis in weekly emails</li>
<li>Recommended that flights get shuffled on bag claims to evenly disperse bag load and prevent one flight from blocking another</li>
<li>Instant impact from identifying gaps in communication and training to bag handlers; bag claim percentage over 85% threshold</li>
</ul>
